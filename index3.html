                The graphics processing unit (GPU), more commonly known as the graphics card, is the largest powerhouse of the computer. It's main function is to do math equations very quickly in parallel.
                In other words, the GPU can do a great deal of smaller math equations all at once. Compare that to the CPU which can only do one thing at a time, although at a far faster rate.
                The GPU is responsible for the visuals on your screen/monitor, and how powerful it may or may not be can affect the output to the screen. The most likely place you'll hear people talk about the GPU is with
                video games sector, where said video games take great advantage of the GPU to make the game playable and pretty.
